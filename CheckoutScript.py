#This was my first project that I strayed away from the class curriculum and wanted to try on my own. I always saw people
#creating and selling bots or scripts to purchase clothing/shoes automatically. I wanted to make one for a brand I
#often would purchase. I had no prior knowledge of selenium until I began researching some ways to control web pages.
#After I found selenium I began to play around and see what I could come up with. I was able to inspect element
#and read through the code on Supreme's website to see what different attributes were named. From there I was
#able to actually get a working script that could load the page, select the category, find the item by name,
#select size and color, add to cart, proceed to checkout, then finally enter in my payment/shipping details.
#I was not able to find a way around captcha so I would have to manually complete the captcha myself.
#Since this script was never shared with anyone, before running, I would hard code the item details,
#payment, shipping, etc.
